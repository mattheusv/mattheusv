### Hi there 👋

I'm currently software enginner at Gympass mostly writing Go code on a distrbuited system environment.
I'm passionate about databases, particularly storage engine and query execution. 

## 📝 Projects
I've build the [tinydb](https://github.com/msAlcantara/tinydb), a simple database based on Postgresql, if you are curious about databases check it out.
